                    <p>Our website aims to spread awareness of the unequal treatment individuals face based solely on their gender, leading to discrimination, exclusion, and limited opportunities. Gender inequality affects people across various domains, such as access to education, fair employment, healthcare, and personal freedoms. By addressing these issues, we seek to highlight the importance of equal treatment and advocate for a world where everyone, regardless of gender, can thrive without prejudice or bias. Through educational resources, stories, and actionable insights, we hope to inspire understanding, empathy, and meaningful change.</p>

                    <p>Gender inequality is the condition in which access to rights, resources, and opportunities is unequally distributed between genders, including men, women, boys, girls, and individuals of other gender identities.This disparity stems from deeply ingrained social norms and power structures that perpetuate discrimination and the unequal distribution of power and privileges.Gender inequality exacerbates the challenges faced by those who are already marginalised, making it a critical issue to address to achieve social justice and equality.</p>
