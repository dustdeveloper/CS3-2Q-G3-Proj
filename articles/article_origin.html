                <p>Gender inequality has deep roots in historical and social systems, evolving over centuries to shape the roles and expectations of men and women. In many traditional societies, patriarchal systems developed, with power concentrated in the hands of men. This structure assigned authority and leadership to men while relegating women to domestic duties, emphasizing their role in caregiving and home management. These gender roles were further enforced by cultural expectations, leading to long-standing perceptions of male superiority and female dependence.</p>
                <p>Legal restrictions also played a significant role in reinforcing gender inequality. Historically, many laws deprived women of economic and personal autonomy. For example, in England, women’s property was legally controlled by their husbands until reforms like the 1870 Married Women’s Property Act began to change this. These limitations not only deprived women of financial independence but also cemented societal views of women as subservient to men (Springer Nature, 2024).</p>
                <p>Politically, women faced exclusion from decision-making processes, denied the right to vote or hold office for centuries. The suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries were pivotal in challenging these restrictions. Activists worldwide fought for women's voting rights, highlighting the broader struggle for gender equality and marking a crucial step towards women's political participation (FutureLearn, 2024).</p>
                <p>In education and employment, gender inequality has historical roots in restricted access to schooling for women. When educational opportunities did increase, women still encountered biases in professional settings, affecting their career progression and reinforcing wage disparities. These patterns underscore how historical norms continue to shape gender dynamics today, making the struggle for equality a persistent and evolving challenge.</p>
